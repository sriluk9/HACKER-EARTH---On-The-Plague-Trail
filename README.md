Predict the total number of people infected by the 7 different pathogens.

Plague is an epidemic event caused by Bacteria. A group of senior scientists misplaced a package containing fatal plague bacteria during one of their trips. With no means of tracking where the package is, scientists are now trying to come up with a solution to stop the plague. This plague has 7 different strains that are unique for each continent. This strain is expanding rapidly in each continent.

The dataset contains escalations of the plague for all the seven strains. The dataset is a time series in which the training set contains the number of individuals that are infected by the plague over a defined period of time.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to defend the world against this plague by building an algorithm that can minimize the damage.
